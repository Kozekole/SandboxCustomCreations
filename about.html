	<h1>
		As a fifth generation Seattleite, Sandy comes from a long line of rugged northwest mountaineers, carpenters, fishermen and landscapers. Through relentless design, muralism, craftsmanship and outdoorsmanship, he aspires to match the hard work of those who built the Puget Sound area to what it is today. Alongside and in collaboration with many local artists, he hopes to write a new chapter in Seattle’s history that those who came before would be proud of.

		A Quick Story...
		</h2>
	<h1>
		It was early September and I had an evening alone in my apartment, burning time and thinking of something to do that night. I wanted to paint, but everyone that I normally went out with was busy or out of town for the night. Although I’d had a fairly productive summer, I knew fall and winter were coming, and the rain would drastically slow me down. I also thought about how dangerous the city gets every turn of the season. Something about the weather changing seems to put everyone on edge, especially the homeless and people who normally populate the places I would paint. After a moment of contemplation, I decided. Screw it. It’s not ideal, but if I’m gonna get numbers up this year, the time is now. 
		<br /><br />
		A moment later, I was tearing through different milk crates digging up colors and looking through sketches that could be used at the spot. The typical anxiety flowed as my mind raced through all kinds of things that could go wrong with being alone in the city at night, especially when you’re doing something that is widely hated. Soon after that, I was loaded with everything and was out the door. Now with more confidence, and hastily marching north towards the freeway. There were places there that would be out of sight from the road at night, so I could complete my work without being seen.<br /><br />
		When I first became interested by the activity of street art, I was puzzled over exactly why anyone would choose to participate. Why would someone risk their personal freedom and even their life for creating such a frownedupon artform? Over the years, I found that creating street art and graffiti is actually a contradictory mess of logic. For example, it is creation that simultaneously destroys. It is seen as an expression of freedom and also as an expression of crime and illegality. A large portion of illegal street art and graffiti is in protest of organisations that ultimately experience little to no effect in consequence of the defacement. In fact, the people that pay for the majority of graffiti clean-up are technically the same middle class taxpayers who create it. Finally, the perpetrators of street art and graffiti are often driven by the fame and respect that comes with participation, however they must also remain anonymous in effort to preserve their personal freedom. This paradoxical nature, to me, suggests this endeavor requires not only lots of effort, but a level of dedication that exceeds logic. <br /><br />
		Years ago, I would learn the consequences of participating in something that ignores reason by nature.When I arrived at the spot, the wind had rose substantially rose and the breeze numbed my fingers and toes. It was also immediately apparent that this wall was fairly well known. All the best places to paint were already taken by some of the other writers in the area, and I wasn’t about to start a future fight with someone else in the community. Just then I saw a ledge that seemed to scale the side of the wall like a ramp. Hidden in the shadows, it was obscured from view and there was a good possibility of a clear spot up the ramp.<br /><br />
		Cans rattling in my bag, I jumped up the ramp and started up the line. The sound of cars roaring by on the freeway echoed off the wall as I patiently sidestepped higher and higher. The paint seemed to get less frequent on the wall about fifty yards up and I soon found a place to begin. Adrenaline rushing, I dreaded how far up I was. Because of the thick blackberry vines growing around the base of the wall and up the face, there was no way of knowing what consequences a slip off of this 14 inch ledge could entail. I blocked it out and awkwardly shuffled my feet on the ramp into a position where I could remove my cans from my bag and start. Letting my muscle memory take the lead, I systematically drained 1500 ml of Rustoleum onto the surface and replaced the empties back into the bag. <br /><br />
 		Feeling like a success, I began my descent down the ramp. Only this time I’m frozen and my muscles are quickly fatiguing. About a quarter of the way down the ramp, there was a bend where I’d find out how stupid my hobby was.The moment I tried to slide around the corner, my foot slipped. “OH F**K!”, I screamed as the ledge vanished from sight, and I plunged into the darkness below. Almost immediately, I landed on the blackberry vines and felt their thorns dig in deep. Tearing my clothes and skin to shreds, the vines managed to slow me down and break my fall all the way to the bottom of the face. Tangled in vines, throbbing with pain, and disoriented, I sat bleeding by myself at the bottom of a 20 fall. I was still alive but not yet able to move, so I thought about how I’d gotten myself into the situation. More importantly, I wondered how I was going to be able to get out. Minutes later, I found myself tunneling through yard after yard of thorns until finally breaking through to the place I first saw the ledge. Determined, to get home, I staggered away from the entrance and marched back south.<br /><br />
		Waking up the next day was difficult. Not only was I in pain from all the cuts and abrasions, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have died the previous night. With this new perspective, I realized the gravity of doing something as unreasonable as graffiti. No matter how passionate/prepared you are for something, you must view the endeavor for what it really is and accept the consequences that may come if you choose to participate. To this day, I get chills thinking about how bad the fall could have been and ever since that night, my favorite kind of pie has been blackberry.
